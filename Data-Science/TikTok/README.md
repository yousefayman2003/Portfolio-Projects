# Introdutcion

In this project, I am trying to apply my skills in data science and machine learning by developing a machine learning model classifying claims made in videos submitted to the TikTok platform and generate valuable insights from their unused data.

<a id="project_scenario"></a>

# Project Scenario

As a data analyst on TikTok's data team, TikTok is the leading destination for short-form mobile video. The platform is built to help imaginations thrive. TikTok's mission is to create a place for inclusive, joyful, and authentic contentâ€“where people can safely discover, create, and connect.

### With new considerations from the leadership team, I will be responsible for:

- Creating a project proposal by assigning the required data analytical tasks into realistic milestones.

### Data team roles

- Willow Jaffey- Data Science Lead
- Rosie Mae Bradshaw- Data Science Manager
- Orion Rainier- Data Scientist

### Cross-functional team members

- Mary Joanna Rodgers- Project Management Officer
- Margery Adebowale- Finance Lead, Americas
- Maika Abadi- Operations Lead

# Project Stages

<a id="project_proposal"></a>

## Project Proposal ([Click Here](https://github.com/yousefayman2003/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Data-Science/TikTok/project_proposal))

In the first stage of the project I received emails from Mr.Rosie Mae Bradshaw and my teammate Orion Rainier to know what the project tasks are and after I knew I assigned them into milestones using PACE strategy.

### About PACE Strategy

- The planning stage is where we conceptualize the scope of the project and develop the steps that will guide you through the process of completing a project.
- The analyzing stage is where we will collect, prepare, and analyze all of the data for your project.
- The construction stage is where we will build models that will allow us access to hidden relationships locked within data.
- The execution stage is where we will present the findings of our analysis, receive feedback, and make revisions as necessary.

## Understand The Data ([Click Here](https://github.com/yousefayman2003/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Data-Science/TikTok/understand_the_data))

This stage aims to investigate and understand the data provided, construct a data frame in Python, perform a cursory inspection of the provided dataset, and inform TikTok data team members of your findings.

### Approach

**Part 1:** Understand the situation

- Prepare to understand and organize the dataset and information by reviewing data dictionary.

**Part 2:** Understand the data

- Create a pandas dataframe for data learning and future exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical activities

- Compile summary information about the data to inform next steps

**Part 3:** Understand the variables

- Use insights from your examination of the summary data to guide deeper investigation into variables

**Part 4:** Share results

- Share an executive summary with my team

## Exploratory Data Analysis ([Click Here](https://github.com/yousefayman2003/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Data-Science/TikTok/EDA))

In this stage, I will conduct exploratory data analysis on data for the claims classification project.

### Approach

1. Imports, links, and loading
2. Data Exploration and Cleaning
3. Data Visualization
4. Results and Evaluation

<a id="hypothesis"></a>

## Hypothesis Testing ([Click Here](https://github.com/yousefayman2003/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Data-Science/TikTok/hypothesis_testing))

In this stage, The purpose is to demostrate knowledge of how to prepare, create, and analyze hypothesis tests and answer the research question:
"is there a difference in number of views between TikTok videos posted by verified accounts and TikTok videos posted by unverified accounts".

### Approach

1. Imports and data loading
2. Conduct EDA and hypothesis testing
3. Communicate insights with stakeholders
4. Results and Evaluation

<a id="regression"></a>

## Regression Analysis ([Click Here](https://github.com/yousefayman2003/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Data-Science/TikTok/regression_analysis))

In this stage, The goal is to build a logistic regression model that predicts verified status and evaluate the model.

### Approach

**Part 1:** Data Preprocessing & Checking Model Assumptions

**Part 2:** Model Building and evaluation

**Part 3:** Interpreting Model Results

<a id="machine"></a>

## Machine Learning ([Click Here](https://github.com/yousefayman2003/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Data-Science/TikTok/machine_learning))

In this stage, The goal is to build a model that predicts whether a TikTok video presents a "claim" or presents an "opinion".

### Approach

**Part 1:** Ethical considerations

**Part 2:** Feature engineering

**Part 3:** Models Building & Evaluation
