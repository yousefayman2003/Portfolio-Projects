# Introduction

In this project, I am trying to apply my skills in data science by enabling New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) riders
to estimate the taxi fares in advance of their ride and generate valuable insights from their unused data.<br><br>

<a id="project_scenario"></a>

# Project Scenario

I am a newly-hired data professional at Automatidata, a fictional data consulting firm. Automatidata works with its clients to transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions, such as performance dashboards, customer-facing tools, strategic business insights, and more. They specialize in identifying a clientâ€™s business needs and utilizing their data to meet those business needs.

In this scenario, I will consult with The New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission to develop an app that will help users (TLC riders) estimate their taxi fares before their ride.

### My responsibilities in the project:

- Structure the necessary tasks into a project proposal that establishes milestones for the ride fare data project.

### Automatidata Team Members:

- Udo Bankole, Director of Data Analysis
- Deshawn Washington, Data Analysis Manager
- Luana Rodriquez, Senior Data Analyst
- Uli King, Senior Project Manager

### New York City TLC Team Members:

- Juliana Soto, Finance and Administration Department Head
- Titus Nelson, Operations Manager

# Project Stages

## Project Proposal ([Click Here](https://github.com/yousefayman2003/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Data-Science/Automatidata/project_proposal))

In the first stage of the project I extracted the project tasks from Automatidata leadership team meeting and used Plan, Analyze, Construct, and Execute (PACE) strategy
for deviding the tasks into a project proposal.

### About PACE Strategy

- The planning stage is where we conceptualize the scope of the project and develop the steps that will guide you through the process of completing a project.
- The analyzing stage is where we will collect, prepare, and analyze all of the data for your project.
- The construction stage is where we will build models that will allow us access to hidden relationships locked within data.
- The execution stage is where we will present the findings of our analysis, receive feedback, and make revisions as necessary.
