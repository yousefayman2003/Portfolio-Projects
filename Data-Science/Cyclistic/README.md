# Cyclistic Bike-Share Project
This project analyzes the usage patterns of Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago, in order to better understand how casual riders and annual members use the service differently. The goal is to use these insights to design a new marketing strategy that will convert more casual riders into annual members.

## Project Scenario
I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations

## Data Source
The data used in this project was provided by Cyclistic and includes 12 months' worth of historical trip data from April 2022 to March 2023. The data includes information on the duration of each trip, the start and end stations, the rider type (casual or member), and the start and end times.

## Analysis Process
The analysis process involved cleaning and transforming the raw data into a format suitable for analysis, exploring the data to identify patterns and trends, and creating data visualizations to communicate the key insights. The analysis was conducted using R and its various libraries, including tidyverse, ggplot2, and readr.

## Key Findings
Through the analysis, the following key findings were identified:

Annual members use the service more frequently and for longer durations than casual riders.
The usage patterns of casual riders vary more widely than those of annual members.
Casual riders are more likely to use the service for leisure or tourism, while annual members use it for commuting or regular transportation.
Casual riders tend to have shorter trips and use the service during weekends or holidays, while annual members use it more during weekdays and rush hours.

## Recommendations
Based on the key findings, the following recommendations are made:

Offer special promotions and discounts to casual riders to encourage them to become annual members.
Create targeted marketing campaigns that cater to the different usage patterns of casual riders and annual members.
Expand the bike-share service to areas with high commuting traffic to attract more annual members.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project provides compelling data insights and visualizations that support the development of a new marketing strategy for Cyclistic. By understanding the differences between casual riders and annual members, Cyclistic can better target its marketing efforts and increase its number of annual memberships.
