## Project Overview
The project involves working with a real-world data set and performing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization to gain insights and answer business questions. The data set used in this project is the Seattle Airbnb Open Data, which contains information about Airbnb listings in Seattle, WA.

## Project Scenario

I have recently been hired as a Data Analyst by a global IT and business consulting services firm that is known for its expertise in IT solutions and its team of highly experienced IT consultants. To keep pace with changing technologies and remain competitive, my organization regularly analyzes data to help identify future skill requirements. As a Data Analyst, I will be assisting with this initiative and have been tasked with collecting data from various sources and identifying trends for this year's report on emerging skills. My first task is to collect the top programming skills that are most in demand from various sources including Job postings, Training portals, and Surveys.

Once I have collected enough data, I will begin analyzing the data and identify insights and trends that may include the following: What are the top programming languages in demand? What are the top database skills in demand? What are the popular IDEs?

I will begin by scraping internet websites and accessing APIs to collect data in various formats like .csv files, excel sheets, and databases. Once this is completed, you will make that data ready for analysis using data-wrangling techniques. When the data is ready you will then want to apply statistical techniques to analyze the data. Then bring all of your information together by using IBM Cognos Analytics to create your dashboard. And finally, show off your storytelling skills by sharing your findings in a presentation. I will be evaluated using quizzes in each module as well as the final project presentation.sing quizzes in each module as well as the final project presentation.

## Requirements
To run the code in this project, you will need the following libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn

## Data Collection
Data was collected from various sources using web scraping and APIs. The data was collected in different formats, including CSV files, Excel sheets, and databases.

## Data Wrangling
Data wrangling techniques were applied to clean and transform the data into a format suitable for analysis. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types.

## Data Analysis
Statistical techniques were applied to analyze the data and identify trends and insights. The analysis focused on identifying the top programming languages, databases, and IDEs in demand.

## Dashboard Creation
IBM Cognos Analytics was used to create a dashboard that presents the findings of the data analysis. The dashboard includes visualizations that provide insights into the popularity of different programming skills.

## Presentation
The findings of the data analysis were presented in a PowerPoint presentation that showcases the insights and trends identified from the data. The presentation includes recommendations for IT and business consulting services firms on how to keep pace with changing technologies and remain competitive.

## Evaluation
The project was evaluated through quizzes in each module as well as the final project presentation. The evaluation criteria included the accuracy of the data collection and analysis, the effectiveness of the data wrangling techniques, the quality of the dashboard, and the clarity and effectiveness of the presentation.

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable experience in collecting and analyzing data on emerging programming skills. The skills and techniques learned in this project can be applied to a wide range of data analysis projects in the future.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank IBM and Coursera for providing this opportunity to learn and practice data analysis skills through the Introduction to Capstone Project. The project was challenging, but also rewarding, and it has helped me develop skills in data collection, data wrangling, statistical analysis, dashboard creation, and presentation.
