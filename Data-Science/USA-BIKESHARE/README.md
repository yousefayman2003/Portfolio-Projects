# Bike Share Data Analysis
This project is a Python-based Streamlit application for exploring bike share data from three major US cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The application reads data from CSV files, performs data wrangling to clean and transform the data, and provides a set of statistics and visualizations to help users explore the data and gain insights into bike share usage patterns.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/bike-share-analysis.git`

2. Install the required libraries:

`pip install streamlit pandas matplotlib seaborn`

3. Start the application:

`streamlit run app.py`

## Usage
1. When you run the application, you will be presented with a sidebar on the left-hand side of the screen that allows you to select a city, month, and day of week to filter the data. You can choose to apply filters to the data or not by selecting the corresponding values.

2. Once you have selected your filters, the system will display a set of statistics and visualizations based on the selected data. You can view the most common month, day, and hour of travel, the most popular stations and trips, and the average trip duration.

3. You can also view additional visualizations by selecting from the options in the sidebar.
